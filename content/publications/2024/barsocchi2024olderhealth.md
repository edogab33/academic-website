abstract="In recent years the demand for health care among older adults, along with requests for hospitalization and related costs, has increased at an unprecedented rate. In the coming decades, this trend is likely to worsen. This detrimental tendency can be mitigated by addressing the problem with a proactive approach. The goal is to ensure continuous monitoring of the older's health status to promptly detect worsening and disease onsets. The paper extends the mid-term results of the Project ChAALenge, by detailing the sensors and the framework underlying the high-level predictive techniques, as well as by reporting qualitative results in terms of physiological measurements from a 4-month data collection campaign in a nursing home.",
